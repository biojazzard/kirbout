The opening tag of a block element must not be indented by more than three spaces.
Any tag indented more than that will be treated as a code block according to standard Markdown rules.

```
+ [Alert](./item1.html)
  - [Cause](./cause1.html)
  <i class="active"></i>
  - [Cause](./cause2.html)
  <i class="active"></i>
+ [Message](./item1.html)
```
When the block element is found inside a list,
all its content should be indented with the same amount of space as the list item is indented.
(More indentation won’t do any harm as long as the first opening tag
is not indented too much and then become a code block — see first rule.)
